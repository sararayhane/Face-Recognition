Face Recognition using HOG vs LBP Features
This repository contains code for a face recognition project that compares the performance of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.

## Overview
In this project, we explore the effectiveness of HOG and LBP feature extraction techniques for face recognition. The goal is to analyze the performance of these two feature extraction methods in combination with KNN and SVM classifiers. The project consists of the following components:

- Feature extraction using HOG and LBP techniques
- Training and evaluation of KNN and SVM classifiers
- Performance comparison

## Features

- **HOG Features:** Histogram of Oriented Gradients is a popular feature extraction technique that captures local gradients and patterns in images.
- **LBP Features:** Local Binary Pattern is a texture descriptor that summarizes local patterns of pixel intensities.
